# Computing 2 Week 4

In this session we will start to look at building the user interface of your
web app.
This is a separate activity from the game logic,
but the two will connect eventually in the end.

The general approach will be to design your interface statically and implement
it in the browser, and once that is done attach event listeners and effects
to the page through `main.js`.

`main.js`'s chief responsibility is the setting up of the page,
and the handling of events.
It will load in domain specific logic, i.e. about your game,
and it's job is to connect the results to the interface.
Not do any of the *thinking* about the game itself.

A nice youtube playlist, by Mozilla, about browser based technologies, the web,
